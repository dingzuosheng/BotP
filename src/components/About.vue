        The original purpose of developing this game is to simulate and study the environmental problems and 
        environmental policies in today's society in the thesis, and to derive and conclude better policies 
        for environmental management by using existing formulas.At first, we only intended to insert half of 
        the environmental factors in the original game, such as the energy policies related to renewable and
        non-renewable energy sources and their effects on the related ecology, but after programming, we found 
        that this did not achieve the expected effect of the experiment. After further consideration, it was 
        decided that the remaining environmental factors from the original game would be transferred to the 
        development of this game, and some scenarios would be simulated, such as the economic and environmental 
        impact of the carbon tax.
